# mobileshop

The website provides a feature for tracking the status of the device.
The shop will send the user a url which contains the info of the customer.
The website has a progress bar attached inside of it which explains the details of the repair, such as the person who is fixing it, the estimated time that it needs to be fixed and also the part that is being used to replace the faulty parts.
There is also another page which is a contact page, it holds the information of the shop and provides a contact form for the customer to communicate with the team.
